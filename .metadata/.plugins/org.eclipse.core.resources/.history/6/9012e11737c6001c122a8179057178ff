//Ranges are another type of collection apart from maps and list
// Creates a list of sequential values
// denoted by first and last value of the sequences
// There are two types of ranges, inclusive & exclusive
//1..10 - inclusive
//1..<10 - exclusive

def range = 1..10
println range //prints 1..10, doesn't not iterate all the elements
println range.size() // prints size, here it is 10
println range.getFrom() // prints starting range
println range.getTo() //prints ending range

assert range.from == 1 //assert basically verifies the value 
assert range.to == 10

println range.get(3) //return 4 as indexing starts from 0
println range[3] //return 4 as indexing starts from 0
